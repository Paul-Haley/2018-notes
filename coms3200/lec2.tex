\subsection{Application Architectures}
\subsubsection{Client-Server}
\begin{description}
	\item[Server:] Always-on host, Permanent IP address
	\item[Clients:] Do not communicate directly with each other, May have dynamic IP addresses
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Peer-to-Peer (P2P)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No always-on server
	\item Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
	\item \textbf{Self Scalability} -- new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
	\item Pers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}{App-layer protocol defines}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{type of messages exchanged} -- e.g. request, response
		\item \textbf{message syntax} -- what fields in messages and how fields are delineated
		\item \textbf{message semantics} -- meaning of information in fields
		\item \textbf{rules} for when and how processes send and respond to messages
		\item \textbf{open protocols} -- defined in RFCs, allows for interoperability (e.g. HTTP, SMTP)
		\item \textbf{proprietary protocols} -- e.g. Skype
	\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\subsection{Transport Service is needed}
\begin{description}
	\item[Data Integrity:] Some programs need 100\% reliable data transfer (e.g. file transfer, web transactions), others can tolerate loss (e.g. audio)
	\item[Timing:] Some programs require low delay to be ``effective'' (e.g. online games)
	\item[Throughput:] Some programs require minimum amount of throughput to be ``effective'' (e.g. multimedia), some use whatever they have available (``elastic apps'')
	\item[Security:] Encryption, Data Integrity
\end{description}

\subsection{Transport Protocol Services}
\subsubsection{TCP}
\begin{description}
	\item[Reliable Transport] between sending and receiving process
	\item[Flow Control:] sender won't overwhelm receiver
	\item[Congestion Control:] throttle sender when network overloaded
	\item[Connection-Oriented:] setup required between client and server processes
	\item[Does Not Provide:] timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
\end{description}

\subsubsection{UDP}
\begin{description}
	\item[Unreliable Data Transfer] between sending and receiving process
	\item[Does Not Provide:] reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Securing TCP}
\textbf{TCP and UDP}
\begin{itemize}
	\item no encryption
	\item cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext
\end{itemize}
\textbf{SSL}
\begin{itemize}
	\item provides encrypted TCP connection
	\item data integrity
	\item end-point authentication
\end{itemize}
\textbf{SSL is at app layer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item app use SSL libraries, that ``talk'' to TCP
\end{itemize}
\textbf{SSL socket API}
\begin{itemize}
	\item cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet encrypted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Web's application layer protocol
	\item client/server model. Client request website and server serves HTTP object in response
	\item Uses TCP
	\item HTTP is stateless. Server maintains no information about past client requests
\end{itemize}
