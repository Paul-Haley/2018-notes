\subsection{Transport vs. Network Layer}
\begin{description}
	\item[Network Layer:] logical communication between hosts
	\item[Transport Layer:] logical communication between processes; relies on, enhances, network layer services
\end{description}

\subsection{Multiplexing/demultiplexing}
\subsubsection{How demultiplexing works}
\begin{itemize}
	\item host receives IP datagrams
	\begin{itemize}
		\item each datagram as source IP address, destination IP address
		\item each datagram carries one transport-layer segment
		\item each segment has source, destination port number
	\end{itemize}
	\item host uses \textbf{IP addresses and port numbers} to direct segment to appropriate socket
\end{itemize}\newpage
\textbf{Connectionless Demultiplexing}
\begin{leftbar}
	A UDP socket needs to have a local port number assigned to it (both client and server)
\end{leftbar}
\textbf{Connection-oriented demux}
\begin{leftbar}
	TCP socket identified by 4-tuple: \textbf{(source IP address, source port number, dest IP address, dest port number)}
\end{leftbar}

\subsection{UDP}\label{sec:udp}
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{UDP Segment Header}
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{32 bits}\\
		\midrule
		source port \# & dest port \#\\
		length & checksum\\
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{application data (payload)}\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{UDP Checksum}
\textbf{Sender:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item treat segment contents, including header fields, as sequence of 16-bit integers
	\item checksum: addition (one's complement sum) of segment contents
	\item sender puts checksum value into UDP checksum field
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Receiver:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item compute checksum of received segment
	\item check if computed checksum equals checksum field value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pipelined Protocols}
\begin{leftbar}
	\textbf{Pipelining:} sender allows multiple, "in-flight", yet-to-be-acknowledged packets. Range of sequence numbers must be increased, buffering at sender and/or receiver.
\end{leftbar}
\subsubsection{Go-Back-N}
\begin{itemize}
	\item sender can have up to$N$ unacked packets in pipeline
	\item receiver only sends \textbf{cumulative ack}. Doesn't ack packet if there's a gap
	\item sender has timer for oldest unacked packet. When timer expires, retransmit all unacked packets
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Selective Repeat}
\begin{itemize}
	\item sender can have up to $N$ unacked packets in pipeline
	\item receiver sends \textbf{individual ack} for each packet
	\item sender maintains timer for each unacked packet. When timer expires, retransmit only that unacked packet
\end{itemize}
