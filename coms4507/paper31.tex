\begin{itemize}
	\item Data is cached and stored on third party machines
	\item Developed a program called Vanish
	\item Vanish encrypts messages after a particular amount of time
	\item If an attacker obtains a cached copy of the message, the user's cryptographic keys, and passwords; the message can't be decrypted
	\item Both a Firefox plugin and File application proof-of-concepts were made
