\section{\#40 The TESLA Broadcast Authentication Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{TESLA:} Times Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication
	\item Broadcast protocol that allows for source authentication
	\item Low communication and computational overhead
	\item Easily scaled to large number of receivers, and tolerates packet loss
	\item Uses symmetric  cryptographic functions (MAC functions)
	\item Assume all network nodes are loosely time synchronized
	\item Time synchronization is required because there needs to be a delay in transmitting the key, if the attacker knows when the key is sent otherwise they could pretend to be the attacker
	\item An attacker could flood the sender with time synchronization requests, leading to a DoS attack
	\item Buffering of packets is needed because the key isn't sent till later
\end{itemize}
Order of execution:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An authentication code is appended to the packet (only sender knows)
	\item Receiver will receive a packet and not know how to authenticate
	\item Later sender will send the key to the receiver, allowing for packet authentication
\end{enumerate}
