\section{\#43 RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Able to get the full 4096-bit RSA keys used for encryption
	\subitem When using the library GnuPG
	\item Uses small acoustic noises made by electric components
	\item Very low bandwidth (20kHz to a few hundred kHz), compared to the GHz-scale clock rates
	\item Takes roughly an hour for a standard attack
	\item Acoustic shield can be used, but makes cooling difficult
	\item Noisy environments can be filtered out in the data processing phase
	\item Parallel software load doesn't help reduce this attack, shifts leakage frequency to a lower range
	\item Cipher text randomization, works by generating a random 4096 bit number and perform few calculations with it. Attack can't distinguish between the real and random number (Modulus randomization works and is similar to this)
	\item Padding the ciphertext with 0s or n-bits, attacker won't know then the ciphertext is beginning
\end{itemize}
