\subsection{\#39 A convenient method for securely managing passwords}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provides a password manager program
	\item Users enter a master password and then get the individual password for that site
	\item Protects against leaked passwords from different sites
	\item Generated passwords are more protected against dictionary and brute force attacks
	\item Instead of the user providing a password for each site (like normal password managers), this generates a password based on the site you are at
	\item Combines site name, username and the master password with a hash function to generate the password
	\item Minimal support for periodic password changes
	\item Changing master password requires changing all the passwords
	\item $k1$ is used during initialization, it is the number of times username and master password are concatenated (cached for session of user)
	\item $k2$ is used during password generation, number of times site name, concatenated with master password, concatenated with with result
\end{itemize}
