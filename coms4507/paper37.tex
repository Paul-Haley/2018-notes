\section{\#37 Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) communicate together over an interval vehicular network
	\item Hacking one of these devices allows the potential to affect other devices
	\item Removal or modification of critical-safety features (stopping of individual wheels, stopping the engine, disabling brakes)
	\item Able to embed code into the car that will erase itself after a crash occurs
	\item Attacks can bypass network security features and bridge between interval vehicular subnets
\end{itemize}
