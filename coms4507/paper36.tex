\section{\#36 Chip and PIN is broken}
\begin{itemize}
	\item EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide
	\item Secures transactions by authenticating card and customer using a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and entry of a PIN
	\item A man-in-the-middle attack is possible, trick the terminal that the PIN was entered while telling the card it wasn't entered
	\item The attack is possible because the PIN is never explicitly authenticated
	\item The attack works by intercepting communication and modify bits that say the card is authenticated
	\item Many banks deny this attack is possible saying the card cannot be used without the correct PIN
\end{itemize}
3 phases of the EMV protocol:
\begin{description}
	\item[Card authentication:] Tells the terminal which bank to communicate with, and that the card is valid
	\item[Cardholder verification:] Tells the terminal that the PIN entered (into the terminal) is the correct PIN for this card
	\item[Transaction authorization:] Tells the terminal that the bank that issues this card will subsequently authorize this transaction
\end{description}
Key steps of the attack:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Card reader is required to read the data of a legit card
	\item That data is fed into a (python) program which pipes the information to an FPGA
	\item FPGA programs the data onto a dummy card
	\item The dummy card allows the attack to listen to the communications between card and terminal
	\item When the (python) program sees the terminal send the PIN, the attack begins $\rightarrow$ the card itself sees that no pin was entered
\end{enumerate}
