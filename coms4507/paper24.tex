\section{\#24 An Analysis of Anonymity in Bitcoin Using P2P Network Traffic}
\begin{description}
	\item[Phase 0:] Prune transaction data to remove potential sources of noise
	\item[Phase 1:] Using relay patterns we have observed for transactions, hypothesize an ``owner'' IP for each transaction
	\item[Phase 2:] Break transactions down into their individual Bitcoin addresses. We do this to create more granular (Bitcoin address, IP) pairings
	\item[Phase 3:] Compute statistical metrics for our (Bitcoin address, IP) pairings
	\item[Phase 4:] Identify pairings that may represent ownership relationships
	\item[Phase 5:] Eliminate ownership pairings that fall below our defined thresholds
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creates a Bitcoin client, CoinSeer, to collect data of the peers in the network (collects about 60GB of data per week)
	\item Able to map between 252 to 1162 Bitcoin addresses to IP addresses that likely owned these addresses
	\item Using ip masking services or online wallets reduces the accuracy of this
	\item No mention of dynamic IPs
\end{itemize}
