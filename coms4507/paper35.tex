\subsection{\#35 Detecting and Defending against third-party tracking on the web}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Estimates that trackers capture up to 20\% of a user's browsing behavior
	\item Two main types of trackers: within-site trackers (like Google Analytics), and cross-site trackers (like DoubleClick)
	\item Firefox addon, ShareMeNot, which drastically mitigates the prevalence of third-party social widget tracking
\end{itemize}
Category of trackers:
\begin{description}
	\item[Analytics:] Within-Site, Serves as third-party analytics engine for sites
	\item[Vanilla:] Cross-Site, Uses third-party storage to track users across sites
	\item[Forced:] Cross-Site, Forces user to visit directly (e.g. via popup or redirect)
	\item[Referred:] Cross-Site, Relies on a \textbf{Vanilla}, \textbf{Forced}, or \textbf{Personal} tracker to leak unique identifiers
	\item[Personal:] Cross-Site, Visited directly by the user in other contexts
