\section{\#42 Honeywords: Making Password-Cracking Detectable}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creates a set of passwords for each account which are ``honeyword'' passwords
	\item When an attacker gets access to the hash passwords, do not know which is real or honeyword
	\item If the honeyword is attempted to be used as a login, alarm is set off
	\item Secondary server is used to check if password is real or honeyword (honeychecker)
	\item Works only if database is compromised, rather than physical system
	\item Works for every account compared to honeypot technique
	\item Open Problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to ensure security of the honeychecker system
		\item How to maintain the integrity of the honeycheck if a compromised computer system attacks it
		\item What to do after the honeyword is entered? Simply disable the triggered account?
		\item How to protect against a man-in-the-middle
		\item Cam password models underlying cracking algortihms be easily adapted for use in chaffing-with-a-password-model
