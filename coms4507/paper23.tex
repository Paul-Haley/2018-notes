\section{\#23 A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Almost impossible to get and trade Bitcoins without giving personal information to an entity (entity, pool, bitcoin exchange, etc)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is assuming you don't solo-mine
	\end{itemize}
	\item Bitcoin blockchain is far from anonymity
\end{itemize}
4 ways to mask Bitcoin transactions (all methods incur transaction costs)
\begin{description}
	\item[Splitting:] Split one ``Dirty Wallet'' into multiple smaller ``Dirty Wallets''
	\item[Folding:] Combining multiple ``Dirty Wallets'' and ``Clean Wallets'' together
	\item[Aggregating:] Combining multiple ``Dirty Wallets'' into one Aggregated Wallet
	\item[Peeling:] Split one ``Dirty Wallet'' into smaller wallets, then each smaller wallet do a change address
\end{description}
Transaction cost has changed from when these were first discovered (\$0.20 USD $\rightarrow$ \$2.30 USD)
