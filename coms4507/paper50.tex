\section{\#50 Client Puzzles: A Cryptographic countermeasure against connection depletion attacks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provides a solution to TCP SYN flooding
	\subitem This is DoS attack where the attacker opens a series of connections and never closes them
	\item The solution is to send a cryptographic puzzle to the client, the client must solve this puzzle before the connection is initiated
	\item The time for the client to solve the puzzle is greater than the server to generate a new puzzle
\end{itemize}
