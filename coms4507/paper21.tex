\section{\#21 On Bitcoin Security in the Presence of Broken Crypto Primitives}
\subsubsection{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Digital currencies reply on cryptographic primitives
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A cryptographic primitive is set of low-level cryptographic algorithms that are used to frequently build cryptographic protocols (hash functions, encryption/decryption functions)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Cryptographic primitives don't last forever. Increased computational power and advanced cryptanalysis cause these primitives to break
	\item Important for a crypto currency to anticipate such breakage
	\item Depending on the primitive and type of breakages, a range of effects are possible. From minor privacy violations to a complete breakdown of the currency
\end{itemize}
