\subsection{\#33 Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows hosts to run functions on sets of encrypted data without decrypting the data first
	\item Functions need to written to handle the encrypted data
	\item Hosts don't need to encryption details
	\item Makes cloud computing more compatible with privacy
	\item Very inefficient (Addition/Subtraction takes seconds, multiplication takes minutes, division takes an hour)
\end{itemize}
