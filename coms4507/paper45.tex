\section{\#45 Sound-Proof: Usable Two-Factor Authentication Based on Ambient Sound}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two-factor accounts protects accounts even if passwords are leaked
	\item Most people don't like the extra step required to login
	\item Either people have to get a code from their phone or install a program on their computer
	\item SoundProof doesn't require the user to interact with their phone
	\subitem Second authentication is the proximity of phone to device logging in
	\item Uses and compares ambient noise to check proximity
	\item Survey favored Sound-Proof over Google 2-Step and majority would be willing to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios which two-factor is optional
\end{itemize}
