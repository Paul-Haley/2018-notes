\section{\#46 Rocking Drones with Intentional Sound Noise on Gyroscopic Sensors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Target drones gyroscope at a frequency under 30kHz
	\item One out of two drones were affected under testing (drones were using targeted gyroscopes, ran 20 trials)
	\item Attack distance of 37.58m if 140dB of SPL (Sound Pressure Level) at 1m is used
	\item Ways to prevent the attack:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Physical Isolation:] Reduce the amount of noise that can reach the device, 1 inch thick foam
		\item[Different Sensor:] Use a different sensor comparator that only responds to resonant frequency
		\item[Resonance Tuning:] Change the resonance frequency of the gyro by adding a capacitor
	\end{description}
\end{itemize}
