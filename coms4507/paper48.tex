\section{\#48 Game of Drones - Detecting Streamed POI from Encrypted FPV Channel}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyzes the bitrate of a wireless transmission between drone and controller
	\item Using physical stimuli (e.g. flash a window), detect the changes in bitrate
	\item If the bitrate increases then the drone is aimed at the physical stimuli
\end{itemize}
