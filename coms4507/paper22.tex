\begin{itemize}
	\item Progression of mining: CPU $\rightarrow$ GPU $\rightarrow$ FPGA $\rightarrow$ ASIC
	\item GPUs have limitations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires computer components to run (Motherboard, CPU, RAM, ...)
		\item Most other boards only have 1 or GPU slots
		\item High energy usage in combination with other computer hardware
		\item Cooling and hardware failure
	\end{itemize}
	\item ASICs were initially crowd funded and produced by inexperienced companies
	\item Takes note that hardware innovation is stagnating because new ideas are expensive to test
\end{itemize}
